While exploring a forest, two young exploreres, Emile and Kayla, discorvered an abandoned village.
Curious, Emile went to explore the ruins. Cautious, Kayla stayed behind, and pleaded for Emile not to go.
Emile, not understanding her friend's worry, went in anyway. Kayla stayed outside.
After not hearing from Emile for a while, Kayla entered the village, to retrieve her friend.
